### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hi, my name is saullo, Iâ€™m a 21 year old software developer ðŸ¤“! Iâ€™m from Brazil and my history with programming started when I was just 10 years old and I got a computer with Intel Core duo, 512MB of RAM, 80GB of HD and 64MB dedicated for integrated video. At that time I started typing/copying codes in PHP to create a blog (but gave up and used Googleâ€™s blogger), after a few years I started studying programming in depth using the C language. When I turned 18 years old, I entered the Pontifical Catholic University of Minas Gerais, majoring in Software Engineering.
